Dataset Information
- The dataset contains details of Titanic passengers:
  - **Features**: Age, Gender, Ticket Class, Fare, Embarkation Port, etc.
  - **Target Variable**: `Survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- Missing values are handled, categorical features are encoded, and numerical features are normalized.
